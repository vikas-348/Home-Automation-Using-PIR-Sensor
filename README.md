# Home-Automation-Using-PIR-Sensor

## Introduction
The recent development in sensor networks has lead to high uses of sensors
for home automation purposes.
• This project develops an automatic fan switching system by sensing the
presence of human beings.
• The project aims to save electricity and the manual need of fan switching
ON and OFF.

## Problem Statement and Objectives
This project aims to develop an automated fan system using PIR sensor and
HC-05 bluetooth module. It will work depending on the human presence
in the room.
● To build a wireless fan system using HC-05 module and PIR sensor.
● To switch the fan ON if a person is present in the room.

## Proposed Solution
Our proposed system would work without any manual intervention. We are
going to build a system with two bluetooth modules where each of the modules
will act as a master and receiver. The master would sense the human presence
with the help of PIR sensor and the receiver will implement the output which is
turning ON the Fa
